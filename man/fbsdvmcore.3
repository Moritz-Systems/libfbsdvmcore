.Sh NAME
.Nm fbsdvmcore
.Nd kernel coredump parsing library
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libfbsdvmcore
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides a uniform interface for accessing FreeBSD kernel
crash dumps. The crash dumps can be examined via the core file generated
by
.Xr savecore 8 .
.Pp
The
.Fn fvc_open
function is first called to obtain a descriptor for all subsequent calls.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The kvm interface was first introduced in SunOS.
A considerable
number of programs have been developed that use this interface,
making backward compatibility highly desirable.
In most respects, the Sun kvminterface is consistent and clean.
Accordingly, the generic portion of the interface has been incorporated
into the libkvm interface.
Indeed, many kvm
applications (i.e., debuggers and statistical monitors) use only
this subset of the interface.
.Pp
The Sun fvc error reporting semantics are poorly defined.
The library can be configured either to print errors to
.Dv stderr
automatically,
or to print no error messages at all.
In the latter case, the nature of the error cannot be determined.
To overcome this, the libkvm interface includes a
routine,
.Xr kvm_geterr 3 ,
to return (not print out) the error message
corresponding to the most recent error condition on the
given descriptor.
.Pp
libfbsdvmcore was created as a portable subset of FreeBSD
.Xr kvm 3
library. Since backwards compatibility was not a concern, it is based
on the most recent version of libkvm API, i.e.:
.Xr kvm_open2 3 ,
.Xr kvm_read2 3 ,
.Xr kvm_geterr 3 ,
etc.
